A good ctf problem must be challenging, creative and not guessy. A ctf challenge is guessy when the gap between steps in solving a problems is too large. I design my problems with this in mind and try to the guide the solver. My most [recent](https://github.com/utisss/UTCTF-22/tree/master/misc1/osint-full) ctf problem was an open source intellinence problem. The problem was to find a bunch of different details about a company email. Once You found them all, you had to email them a phishing email to get the flag. 

An issue with my problem was that I didn't provide any feedback to the players who were playing my problem when their email didn't include the right information. It was confusing for the players to send an email and not recieve any response back. This led to me getting lots of DMs asking whether the bot was broken. I should have a more detailed response telling players which details they got wrong.

It was cool to read peoples [write ups](https://github.com/LambdaMamba/CTFwriteups/tree/main/UTCTF_2022/cryptography/scrambled) of my challenge
